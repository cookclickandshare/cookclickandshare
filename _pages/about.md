My name is **`ahmed zbyr`** and I am full time Biker and a part time Engineer ;). 
I am not all that good about talking about my self but here are few things.

I love bikes and EVs. EVs on 2 wheels even more [`Lightning LS-218`](http://lightningmotorcycle.com/product/specifications/). Apart from bikes I love automation.
I go by this statement most of the time [`"if a task takes more than 90sec then there should be a script for it ;)"`](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts).
