### Hello Everyone 

Peace and blessing be upon you :) How do I begin....

Well firstly iam an introvert so you wont find detail happenings about my recipes ... but of course the recipe is in place :). 

I am a food lover, love eating, cooking and serving but my better half is a non foodie who only likes roti, dal and spicy kababs.. these are his "only" favorites. 

He is my best and strict :P critic for the food I cook, he will rate my dish from 1 to 5 (5 being the highest) which helps me get better and improve. 

So guys this is Heena Kausar in short for u. Hope you like my recipes. Happy Cooking !!! :) :) :)
