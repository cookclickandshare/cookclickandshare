A `kathi roll` (sometimes spelt kati roll; Bengali: কাঠি রোল) is a street-food dish originating from Kolkata, India. In its original form, it is a skewer-roasted kebab wrapped in a paratha bread, although over the years many variants have evolved all of which now go under the generic name of kathi roll. 

Today, mostly any wrap containing a filling enfolded in an Indian flatbread (roti) is called a kati roll. In native Bengali, the word Kati roughly translates to "Stick", referring to how they were originally made. In Bengal though, the delicacy is simply known as `roll`. Kati Rolls normally contain coriander chutney, egg and chicken but the types may vary. But today we will be making the one with `Chicken`, `Egg`, `Green Chutney` in it.

We will be creating this in multiple steps.

1. Create a Dough.
2. Green Chutney.
3. Creating the Filling. 
4. Get the roll ready. 

## Creating a Dough.

- Wheat flour
- Maida
- Salt
- Oil
- Egg - 1 
- Curd - 2 tbsp
- Water

I used wheat flour and maida in half n half quantity, mix all the above ingredients and make a dough.
Brush some oil on the dough, cover it and allow it to rest for an hour.


## Creating Green Chutney.

- Coriander - 1 bunch
- Mint leaves - 1 bunch
- Green chilies - 4 - 5
- Cumin seeds - half tsp
- Garlic pods - 4 
- Juice of one lemon
- Salt

Blend all the above ingredients using very little water and keep aside.

## Creating Filling.

- Boneless chicken - half kilo (cut in to bite size)
- Finely chopped onion - 1
- Thinly sliced onion - 1
- Finely chopped tomato - 1 medium size
- Finely chopped coriander - half cup
- Ginger garlic paste - 1 tbsp
- Red chili pwdr - 1 tsp
- Cumin pwdr - half tsp
- Garam masala pwdr - half tsp
- Coriander pwdr - half tsp
- Chat masala - half tsp
- Turmeric pwdr - half tsp
- Tandoori chicken masala - half tsp
- Lemon juice - 2 tsp
- Eggs
- Salt
- Oil

## Method - Gettin'em All Together.

First we get the `chicken filling` ready, and then add it to the `roti with egg`.

### Getting the Mix ready.

- Heat 4-5 tbsp oil in a pan.
  - add finely chopped onions and 
  - fry them until slightly golden,
  - now add ginger & garlic paste, salt and saute this for a minute then,
  - add chopped tomatoes and dry masalas and 
  - allow it cook on low flame until the oil oozes out.
- Now add chicken and mix well and allow it to cook on medium flame until the chicken is soft and tender.
  - add lemon juice to it and mix. 
- Once the chicken is cooked and its dry turn off the stove and keep it aside.
- Whisk one egg with little salt and keep aside.

### Getting the Roll `rolling`.

- Just before u begin to roll the rotis add thinly sliced onions and chopped coriander to the chicken mixture.
- Take small portion of the dough and roll it to a 8 inch roti.
- Put the roti on tawa.
  - when it is half cooked, spread some oil on one side of the roti and 
  - pour the whisked egg (`above step`) on it and spread it evenly, 
  - now flip the roti and cook it ( `should be quick while doing this or else the roti will get burnt`)
- Place the `egg-roti` on a plate and add 2 - 3 tbsp of the `chicken filling` and spread some `green chutney` in a line down the center of the roti and roll it tightly and poke a toothpick in the center, so that roll doesn't fall apart.

Relish the yummmyyyyy roll :).
