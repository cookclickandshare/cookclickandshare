Tandoori chicken is chicken dish prepared by roasting chicken marinated in yoghurt and spices in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. It is a popular dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, and has become sought-after in other parts of the world.

I got this recipe from my sister Ruby and trust me if you make it once you will never stop making it again and again and moreover it consume less time and effort compared to other chicken dishes.
