Shashlik or shashlyk (Persian: شیشلیک‎ – Šišlik, Armenian: խորոված khorovats, Azerbaijani: şişlik or tikə kabab, Georgian: მწვადი mtsvadi, Russian: шашлы́к šašlýk, Ukrainian: шашли́к šašlýk, Polish: szaszłyk, Latvian: šašliks, Lithuanian: šašlykas, Turkish: şaşlık, Hebrew: שישליק‎ šíšliq, Urdu: شاشلِک śāślik, Bengali: শাশলিক śāślik), is a name given to a dish of skewered and grilled cubes of meat popular in Eastern Europe, eastern Central Europe, the Baltics, Caucasus, Central Asia and some parts of the Middle East, including Iran, Israel, and Turkey.

Shashlik (meaning skewered meat) was originally made of lamb. Nowadays it is also made of pork or beef, chicken depending on local preferences and religious observances. The skewers are either threaded with meat only, or with alternating pieces of meat, fat, and vegetables, such as bell pepper, onion, mushroom and tomato.

My first attempt on pan fried Chicken Shashlik, must say this dish is worth cooking often :)
